## **UX**

### **Project Goals**

The goal of this project is to provide users with a space where they can cultivate their own
journal on the internet, using whichever internet-capable device is most easily accessible to them.
The finished site will be clean, efficient, and not so frilly that it becomes cluttered up or
difficult to navigate. The purpose of this site is to be personal, as opposed to a blog which
is intended to be shared.

### **User Goals**

* Ability to create my personal account.
* Ability to login to my personal account.
* Ability to logout of my personal account.
* Ability to create personal entries.
* Ability to edit personal entries.
* Ability to delete personal entries.
* Ability to use a search function for key words across entries.
* Responsiveness to different devices.
