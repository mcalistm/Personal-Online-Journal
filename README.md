## **UX**

<a></a>

### **Project Goals**

The goal of this project is to provide users with a space where they can cultivate their own
journal on the internet, using whichever internet-capable device is most easily accessible to them.
The finished site will be clean, efficient, and not so frilly that it becomes cluttered up or
difficult to navigate. The purpose of this site is to be personal, as opposed to a blog which
is intended to be shared.

### **User Goals**

* Ability to create my personal account.
* Ability to login to my personal account.
* Ability to logout of my personal account.
* Ability to create personal entries.
* Ability to edit personal entries.
* Ability to delete personal entries.
* Ability to use a search function for key words across entries.
* Responsiveness to different devices.

### **Design Choices**

I searched the term "forest" in [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to find the 
color scheme that I ultimately used for this site. I decided on this search term because
I wanted calming, relaxed colors that had a woodsy, natural vibe to them, an aesthetic
often associated with journaling. I chose to avoid using white as a background because
of the textual nature of this site - something I learned in my teaching courses is that
people with reading difficulties such as dyslexia often find reading on a white background
much more difficult than reading on a cream colored background. I also chose to avoid
white because of the digital nature of this site, and the connection between blue light 
given off by white screens and deterioration of sleep cycles.
